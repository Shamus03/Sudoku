# Sudoku
This progam solves all Sudokus in a given text file.

Pass a file containing the Sudokus to be solved as a command line argument.  The included sets of puzzles are from http://www.printable-sudoku-puzzles.com/wfiles/

The command line option "-r" will force the program to use only the recursive solving method (no exposed/hidden singles will be found).

The included shell scripts format the output of the program for easier data collection.
